# Insertsort-Assembly
This project implements the "Insertsort" sorting algorithm in Assembly language and optimizes the program using the WinMIPS64 Instruction Set Architecture simulator. The different versions of the code include optimizations such as loop unrolling, register renaming, and instruction reordering to improve the program's performance.
